-- 0291: the lift clears the subject's own address too.
--
-- 0290 made lifting a restriction erase the CONTENT — body, subject, raw — and
-- stopped there. counterparty_email survived, which is the subject's own email
-- address sitting on a row whose whole purpose was to complete their Art. 17
-- request. The content went and the identifier stayed, so the record still
-- named the person who asked to be forgotten.
--
-- The real eraser already knows this: erasuretimeline.go nulls
-- counterparty_email in the same statement it clears the body. The guard was
-- simply asking for less than the caller already does, and a guard that asks
-- for less than the correct behaviour is one that will eventually admit the
-- incorrect one.
--
-- source_id and thread_key are deliberately NOT required here. The eraser
-- clears them only for channel rows, where they encode the subject's account
-- id; on a mail row they are provider bookkeeping that names nobody, and
-- demanding them unconditionally would refuse the erasure the module actually
-- writes.
